ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tomoya-S

I am a system engineer in Osaka, Japan.  
I have been studying alone in detail, but I have not been doing any output at all.  
It often takes me a long time to build an environment, and I think others might as well, so I hope I can create and distribute a base.  

I am always looking for an environment where I can improve my skills as an engineer.
